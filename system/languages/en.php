	<b>Method 1</b><br>
	The BigMacroTool spamming you as possible and most of the rooms so quickly in the hotel,
	Spam 5x your sense alternately and then change rooms.
	This method seems to be, as it is the best only gives a chance gringere be banned in the fast.
	<br><br>
	<b>Method 2</b><br>
	Create a room with an enticing name ( "Give rare rares road") at the hotel where you are spamming.
	In the room you then create a Spammwired (WIRED effect: message to the user and shutter WIRED: effect repeats every x seconds), which is a slogan.

	<img src="/templates/brain/style/images/icons/read_all_about_it_small_promo.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 0px;">
	<br>
	<b>Method 3</b><br>
	Take a stroll through the 5 most rooms and each user a friend request.
	Then send them via private message advertising slogan or write to the user. '.$config['hotelName'].', convince the umihn.
	<br><br>
	<b>Method 4</b><br>
	You can advertise on social networks (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Skype, WhatsApp, etc.).
	<br><br>
	<b>Methode 5</b><br>
	You can also advertise in news from other websites.';

	<b>Step 1.</b><br>
	Looking for a spam tool? then type in google "Free Cok auto Typer."
	<br><br>
	<b>Step 2.</b><br>
	Friends think a short, informative slogan due to '.$config['hotelName'].' and save it in your BigMacroTool and spamming it!
	<br><br>
	<b>Step 3.</b><br>
	-
	<br><br>
	<b>Step 4.</b><br>
	Sign in to another hotel. The names of these will be announced at the promotional rounds.
	Of course, you can also advertise in other social networks (Facebook, Skype, Twitter, etc.) for the Holohotel
	<br><br>
	<b>Step 5.</b><br>
	Consider either a heavy user name friends obviating delay (z.B iijijilliji) or the name of a normal user as in '.$config['hotelName'].', So your act directly in the entrance hall is striking.
	<br><br>
	<img src="/templates/brain/style/images/icons/spromo_dolphin.gif" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;">
	<b>Step 6.</b><br>
	If you advertise, advertise quickly before you get a staff exile. Do not let big breaks!
	<br><br>
	<b>Step 7.</b><br>
	Put your advertising 2-4 x in a crowded room and then quickly change! Make sure there is no staff to see this!
	<br><br>
	<b>Tip</b><br>
	Advertising in a group makes more than just. You do with your friends or for promotional rounds advertise with us!
